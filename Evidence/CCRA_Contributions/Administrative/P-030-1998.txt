When a particular person (i.e., supplier) adjusts, refunds or credits an excess amount of tax or, tax on consideration that has subsequently been reduced, to another person (i.e., recipient), the particular person is required to issue a credit note within a reasonable time, including prescribed information, to the other person (unless the other person first issues a debit note to the particular person).  Provided specified requirements are met, the particular person is allowed to deduct the amount of the tax adjustment, refund or credit when determining its net tax for the reporting period in which the credit note is issued to the other person or the debit note is received by the particular person, to the extent that the amount has been included in determining the net tax for that reporting period or a preceding reporting period of the particular person.  Similarly, the other person is required to add the amount of the tax adjusted, refunded or credited when determining its net tax for the reporting period in which the credit note is received by the other person or the debit note is issued to the particular person, to the extent that the amount has been included in determining an input tax credit claimed by the other person in a return filed for the reporting period or a preceding reporting period of the other person.

It is the Department's position that where a person is required under section 232 to add an amount in determining its net tax, that amount should be recorded as an adjustment on line 104 of the GST/HST return.  Where the person may deduct an amount under section 232 in determining its net tax, that amount should be recorded on line 107 of the return.  Alternately, persons may include the amount required to be added on line 103 (i.e., GST/HST Collected or Collectible) or include the amount that may be deducted on line 106 (i.e., Input Tax Credits) of the GST/HST return.
