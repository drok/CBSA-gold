When a particular person (i.e. supplier) adjusts, refunds or credits an amount of tax to another person (i.e. recipient), the particular person is required to issue a GST credit note, including prescribed information, to the other person. Provided specified requirements are met, the particular person is allowed to deduct the amount of the tax adjustment, refund or credit from its net tax. Similarly, the other person, if it is a registrant, is required to add the amount of the tax adjustment, refund or credit to its net tax to the extent that the amount was deducted from its net tax.

It is the Department's administrative position that, as a general principle, registrants be required, under section 232, to make a GST adjustment on line 104 of the GST return or to deduct an ITC adjustment on line 107. Also that, notwithstanding the general principle, it will be acceptable for registrants to add a GST adjustment on line 103 or to deduct an ITC adjustment on line 106 of the GST return.
